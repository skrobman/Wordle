# Wordle Game

Welcome to the Wordle game! This is a simple browser-based implementation of the popular word-guessing game. Your goal is to guess the correct 5-letter word in 5 attempts. Each attempt provides feedback on the accuracy of your guess, helping you get closer to the correct word.

## How It Works

The game board consists of 5 rows, each with 5 cells for the 5 letters of the word. The user has 5 attempts to guess the correct word. After each guess:

- **Green (Correct)**: The letter is in the correct position.
- **Yellow (Present)**: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
- **Red (Absent)**: The letter is not in the word at all.

### Steps:

1. **Input Letters**: The user can type one letter per cell in each row. When all 5 cells in a row are filled, the user can submit the guess.
2. **Feedback**: After submitting the guess, the cells change color based on the accuracy of the guess.
3. **Next Row**: If the guess is incorrect, the next row becomes editable. If the guess is correct, the game ends with a success message.
4. **Game Over**: If the user uses all attempts without guessing the word correctly, the game ends with a failure message.

### Game Logic

1. **Word Generation**: The game fetches a random 5-letter word from an external API (`https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?length=5`), ensuring that itâ€™s a valid word.
2. **Input Validation**: The game validates the input to ensure the user is only typing one letter at a time in each cell.
3. **Feedback Mechanism**: After every guess, the system compares the guess to the target word and provides feedback in the form of colors:
   - **Green**: The letter is correct and in the right position.
   - **Yellow**: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
   - **Red**: The letter is not in the word.
4. **Next Row Activation**: After each guess, the game disables editing for the current row and moves to the next one.
5. **End Conditions**: If the word is guessed correctly or all attempts are used up, the game concludes.

## Design

- **Responsive Layout**: The game board and interface are designed to be responsive and easy to use across different devices.
- **Intuitive UX**: Each letter in the guess is interactive, providing a seamless experience for the user.
- **Colorful Feedback**: The color-coded feedback (Green, Yellow, Red) makes it easy for users to understand how close they are to guessing the correct word.
